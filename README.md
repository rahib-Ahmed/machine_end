## Proposed Model 

The waste segregator system is a eco-friendly and social solution to lots of waste a person or a family does in its household. The application encourages users to recycle and reuse. The system consists of mainly of two components, trash can and mobile phone. Whenever user throws a trash, he can track what kind of trash he is utilizing regularly and explains user about how good or bad trash user is using. Also it suggest user to use less plastic waste if he/she is utilizing more plastics than usual. This way application is designed to provide a good motive to the people.
